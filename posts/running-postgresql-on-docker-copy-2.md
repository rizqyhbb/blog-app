There are a lot of Database management known now days, but Postgre Sql (later I'll call it _postgres_) is one the most well known. For new learner, Postgres will be a very first option to learn. If you ever install and run your _postgres_ from your linux machine, unix (MaxOs) or windows it's great, but have you wonder how we can run _postgres_ without installed it to your computer?

This articles will show you the most minimal setup to run your Postgre Sql as a container and visualized it using Dbeaver.

## Getting Started

1. Familiar with Docker (at least know the terms like _container_, _image_ and basic CLI)

## Prerequisite

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed
2. [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) installed
