# **Build Next.js Project to Image Using Docker**

## **Introduction**

Building and deploying Next.js projects using Docker containers can simplify the development and deployment process. In this article, we will explore how to build a Next.js project into a Docker image, enabling easy deployment and portability.

## **Understanding Next.js and Docker**

Before diving into the process, let's briefly understand Next.js and Docker:

Next.js: Next.js is a popular React framework for building server-rendered and statically generated web applications. It provides powerful features such as server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and optimized performance.

Docker: Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment and scaling of applications within containers. It provides a consistent and isolated environment for running applications, ensuring portability and easy management.

## **Setting Up a Next.js Project**

To build a Next.js project with Docker, you first need to have a Next.js project set up on your local machine. If you haven't created one yet, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js on your machine if you haven't already.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the desired directory where you want to create the Next.js project.
3. Run the following command to create a new Next.js project:

```shell
npx create-next-app my-next-project
```

4. Change into the project directory:

```shell
cd my-next-project
```

## **Creating a Dockerfile**

A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions on how to build a Docker image. To create a Docker image for your Next.js project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your Next.js project.
2. Open the `Dockerfile` in a text editor.
3. Add the following content to the `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js 14 image as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the entire Next.js project to the container
COPY . .

# Build the Next.js project
RUN npm run build

# Expose the default Next.js port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the Next.js server
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## **Building the Next.js Project Image**

To build the Next.js project image with Docker, execute the following steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your Next.js project where the `Dockerfile` is located.
2. Run the following command to build the Docker image:

```shell
docker build -t my-next-app .
```

The `-t` flag is used to tag the image with a name (`my-next-app` in this case).

## **Running the Next.js Project Image with Docker**

Once the Docker image is built, you can run it as a Docker container. Follow

these steps to run the Next.js project image:

1. In your terminal, run the following command:

```shell
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-next-app
```

The `-p` flag is used to map the container's port (`3000`) to the host's port (`3000`). This allows accessing the Next.js application on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your Next.js application running within the Docker container.

## **Customizing the Docker Image**

You can customize the Docker image according to your project's requirements. Here are a few common customizations:

- Install additional dependencies by adding them to the `Dockerfile`.
- Configure environment variables using the `ENV` instruction in the `Dockerfile`.
- Modify the Next.js project's configuration files to suit your needs.

## **Optimizing Next.js Project Image with Multi-Stage Builds**

Multi-stage builds allow you to create optimized Docker images by separating the build environment from the runtime environment. This helps reduce the size of the final image. To optimize the Next.js project image with multi-stage builds, you can read the example provided by vercel here [nextjs with docker example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-docker/Dockerfile)follow these steps:

**IMPORTANT**
As we're gonna build it as standalone, first we need to add configuration to `next.config.js`:

```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  output: "standalone",
};
```

1. Modify your `Dockerfile` as follows:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS base

# Install dependencies only when needed
FROM base AS deps
# Check https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/tree/b4117f9333da4138b03a546ec926ef50a31506c3#nodealpine to understand why libc6-compat might be needed.
RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies based on the preferred package manager
COPY package.json yarn.lock* package-lock.json* pnpm-lock.yaml* ./
RUN \
  if [ -f yarn.lock ]; then yarn --frozen-lockfile; \
  elif [ -f package-lock.json ]; then npm ci; \
  elif [ -f pnpm-lock.yaml ]; then yarn global add pnpm && pnpm i --frozen-lockfile; \
  else echo "Lockfile not found." && exit 1; \
  fi


# Rebuild the source code only when needed
FROM base AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .

# Next.js collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage.
# Learn more here: https://nextjs.org/telemetry
# Uncomment the following line in case you want to disable telemetry during the build.
# ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

RUN yarn build

# If using npm comment out above and use below instead
# RUN npm run build

# Production image, copy all the files and run next
FROM base AS runner
WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV production
# Uncomment the following line in case you want to disable telemetry during runtime.
# ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public

# Automatically leverage output traces to reduce image size
# https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/output-file-tracing
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/static ./.next/static

USER nextjs

EXPOSE 3000

ENV PORT 3000

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

2. Rebuild the Docker image using the updated `Dockerfile`:

```shell
docker build -t my-next-app .
```

## **Deploying Next.js Docker Image**

To deploy the Next.js Docker image, you can use various platforms and services such as Kubernetes, AWS ECS, or any other container orchestration solution. Consult the documentation of your preferred deployment platform for specific instructions.

## **Conclusion**

Building a Next.js project into a Docker image offers portability and streamlined deployment. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can efficiently package your Next.js application and run it in a Docker container. This approach simplifies the development workflow and ensures consistent performance across different environments.

## **FAQs**

1. **Can I use Docker for Next.js development even if I'm not deploying with Docker?**

   - Absolutely! Docker can be used for local development, allowing you to replicate the production environment on your machine. It helps ensure consistency and makes it easier to share the project with other developers.

2. **Are there any performance considerations when running Next.js in a Docker container?**

   - Docker adds a minimal overhead, but the performance impact is generally negligible. Next.js performs optimally within a Docker container, and you can still leverage its powerful features like server-side rendering and automatic code splitting.

3. **Can I use Docker Compose to orchestrate a Next.js project with multiple services?**

   - Yes, Docker Compose is a great tool for orchestrating multi-container applications. You can define your Next.js service along with any additional services (e.g., a database) in a `docker-compose.yml` file to simplify the deployment and management of the entire stack.

4. **Is it necessary to build the Next.js project within the Docker image?**
   - Building the Next.js project within the Docker image ensures that the image contains the optimized production-ready code. It eliminates any potential inconsistencies between the development environment and the final deployment environment.

5

. **Can I use a different port for the Next.js application within the Docker container?**

- Yes, you can modify the `EXPOSE` instruction in the `Dockerfile` to expose a different port. Additionally, you'll need to update the port mapping in the `docker run` command accordingly.
